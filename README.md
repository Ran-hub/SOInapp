One of the great things about owning a mobile app is the variety of available methods to earn money from app, namely paid, free with ads, and in-app purchases.

Nowadays, many mobile applications provide an option to get extra content by purchasing them through the app. For example, Mobile Game – Subway Surfers – provides gems from in-app purchases to get more lives.

With that being said, it’s an undeniable fact that most of the developers’ revenue last longer in Apple in-app purchase than other options.
And if you think about it, this is nice option for users as well. They can download your app for free and use it, and if they like it they will do the in-app purchases.
